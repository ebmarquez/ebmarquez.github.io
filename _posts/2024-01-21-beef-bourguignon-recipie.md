## My Notes
I ended up using larger servings, and added more liquid than I should have but it still had an amazing taste.  The next time I make it, I will stick a bit closer to the recipie this way the stew is a bit thicker.

I also used chicken broth instead of beef and for the wine I used a Costco Kirkland Signature Bordeaux. 

This was enough to feed a family of 5, two of which are teenage boys.

## Ingredients

- 3 lbs beef chuck, cut into 2 inch chunks
- 8 oz bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, medium diced
- 2 TBSP minced garlic
- 2 TBSP tomato paste
- 2 TBSP all-purpose flour
- 2 cups red wine, preferably pinot noir or merlot
- 1 cup Chicken Broth or Beef Bone Broth
- 10-12 sprigs thyme, tied into a bundle with butcher’s twine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp salt, or to taste
- Cracked black pepper, to taste
- 2 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
- 4 oz mushrooms of your choice, cut into smaller pieces

## Instructions
I pulled these instructions from the instagram video.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Add the bacon to a dutch oven over medium to medium low heat and cook until most of the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon and set aside.
3. Sear the beef chuck in the bacon fat until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
4. To the bacon fat, add the onion and cook until it starts to turn translucent. Add the bacon back in along with minced garlic. Cook until the garlic is fragrant.
5. Then add the tomato paste and cook until combined, about 15 to 30 seconds.  Following, sprinkle in the flour and cook until well combined, about 15 to 30 seconds.
6. Add the red wine to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to help lift the fond (aka the browned bits aon the bottom).
7. Place the seared chunks back into the pot and add enough Chicken broth or Beef broth to cover the beef.  Season with salt and add the thyme and bay leaves.
8. Bring the stew to a simmer, cover with a lid, and place it into the oven. Allow the stew to cook for about 2 to 3 hours then add the carrots and mushrooms. Return the stew back into the oven and cool for 1 more hour until the beef is fork tender.  A total braising time of about 3 to 4 hours.
9. Once the beef is tender, remove the stew from the oven. Discard the thyme and bay leaves and season with some black pepper.  Adjust with more stalk if needed as well
10. Enjoy the beef bourguignon wil hot over some creamy mashed potatoes.
