In July when the neowise comet approaching I decided to setup my GoPro with a timelapse setting.  I didn't really think I would catch the comet in the timelapse but I thought this would be fun to setup and look at.  This is a view of my office window during the week, as you can see not much happens except the clouds are moving across the sky.
