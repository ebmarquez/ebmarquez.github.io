        Hi, my name is Eric Marquez,<br />
        I'm a Principal Software Engineer automating the configuration of network
        devices. This requires understanding network designs, protocols, QOS,
        code, continues integration, and other emerging technologies that are
        always popping up. I spend a great deal of time thinking about automating
        networks, improving the networking environment, supporting upcoming
        solutions, working with BGP and improving my development environment.

<br>
        Along with all the technology I learn and thing about on a daily basis,
        I'm a proud parent of 3 kids with my loving wife. When we can, we try to
        get out of the Seattle area and travel. I've always found traveling to be
        a fun experience and it's interesting to experience new places are see
        the world in a different perspective.
