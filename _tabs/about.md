I'm a Principal Software Engineer managing a team of engineers that automates data center switches. I was the first team member supporting the network. This allowed me to architect and build solutions for the product's data center switches. The product itself was an autonomous on-premises cloud solution. In this role I created a network toolkit to support the switches. I spend a great deal of time thinking about automating networks, improving the environment, supporting upcoming solutions, working with BGP, and improving my development environment.
Along with all the technology I learn daily, I'm a proud parent of 3 kids with my loving wife. When possible, my family and I travel out of the  Seattle area. I mostly travel with the kids supporting their team sports (hockey and softball). My hobbies include hockey, snoboarding, golf, home automation projects, and coding.
