Recently I was working with a Cisco Nexus 93600CD-GX I encountered an odd error that took a little time to figure out.  This is a devices has 100G and 400G ports with the capability to set various speeds from 10G, 40G, 100G.  It's an impressive device, but when the 100G cable were connected I started to see a speed error on the interfaces.  This was a new device so as with new devices these types of things can happen.  As I searched the internet I didn't come across a lot of details with the error. "
Transceiver speed does not match the speed configured on the port"
